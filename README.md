# NBA-Crystal-Ball
This program scrapes NBA data using Jsoup on Java. After extracting all the data, the program uses various comparable, abstract, and interface classes to formulate rankings through a custom algorithm which determines which NBA teams have the highest likelihood of winning the NBA finals. The program then showcases results via a GUI.
